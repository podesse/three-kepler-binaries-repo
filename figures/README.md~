# Figures

Here you will find several figures included in this paper, or associated to this research.

Disclaimer for GitHub Dark Mode users: Many of these figures were generated with transparent backgrounds. This means that the axis titles and values will blend into the background when using dark mode. I'm still working on a fix for this issue.

## Binned Runs and Full Runs

Figures from the MCMC analysis of the binned light curves are presented in the `binned_runs` directory, organized by system. Figures from the MCMC analysis of the full light curves can be found in the `full_runs` directory, also organized by system.

These directories include (but are not limited to): log-probability plots, trace plots, corner plots of various size, light curves and residuals.

As a bonus, fully animated GIFs of all systems are displayed below.
